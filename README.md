# Google Application Auth HTTP Client

A NodeJS HTTP client that authenticates with Google API services. Uses oauth2 application authentication. Useful for system/cli applications.

## Important
I consider this project deprecated as Google have released a NodeJS API library that provides oauth authentication as well as
code wrappers around their API. See https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client
